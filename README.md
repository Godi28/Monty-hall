## Description
A game called monty-hall where the user gets to try and guess which door has the hidden prize from a choice of 3 doors.

## Installation
Download and Install Node JS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/. After installation check if it was installed correctly by running 'node -v' and 'npx -v' in command prompt or powershell. 
If installed correctly you should be able to the installed versions.

Go to the directory where 'monty-hall' is located on your local machine in command prompt or powershell and type 'npm i react-scripts'.

After it has loaded in the same directory in command prompt or powershell type 'npm start'. Once it has loaded open a web browser and go to 'localhost:3000' if it has not opened automatically. 
This is where you can play the game.

## Usage
Click on any door of your choice as a first guess and it will be highlighted and another losing door will be opened.

Click on one of the remaining doors as a selection of the choice of the final door and see if you have located the prize.
